# The Role of Libraries in Advancing Research at Mexican Normal Schools: A Qualitative Study 

Situated within a broader ethnography of Mexican normal school libraries, this study examines to what extent these often-overlooked libraries advance the research of pre-service teachers and faculty. Despite limited resources, these libraries provide services essential to the mission of the normales, including collections, research support, and outreach programs. The study employs a qualitative methodology, incorporating semi-structured interviews with librarians, faculty, and recent graduates; observations of library operations; and an analysis of library collections.
